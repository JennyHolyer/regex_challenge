    <h1>Regex Challenge</h1>
    <p>In Django, we'll be using regular expressions for routing.  Regex can also be handy in many situations, and most languages support some form of regex.  It's a great skill to have, and the more profficient you become the more it will start to feel like a super power!</p>
    <p>But what is a regex, you might ask.  A regex is simply a pattern we can match to any string.  If that pattern matches a given string, we have a match, if not we continue our search.  Find all the info you need to get started here: <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/re.html">https://docs.python.org/2/library/re.html</a>
    </p>
    <p>In order to get started with regex in python, we must import the re library into our document:</p>
    <pre>import re</pre>
    <p>Regualr expressions are preceeded by r, like so:</p>
    <pre>r"a"</pre>
    <p>This regex would match any string containing the letter a.</p>
    <p>Let's take a look at some more complete code.  Navigate to this Github repo: then, fork and clone, and you're ready to go!  Below are some regex exercises to get you started.  No answers are provided, but running your code is the best way to find out if you've answered correctly.  I've provided the regex for the first few, try to predict the output.  For the rest, try creating your own regular expressions!</p>
